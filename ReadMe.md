## Getting Started with Tableau

### Downloading and Installing Tableau
1. Visit the [Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com/) and download Tableau Desktop (you can start with a free trial)
2. Install the application following the on-screen instructions
3. Launch Tableau Desktop

### Tableau Versions
- **Tableau Public**: Free version with limited features, requires publishing to Tableau Public server

4. Click "Open"

### Data Source Page
After connecting, you'll see the Data Source page where you can:
- Preview the data
- Change data types
- Create relationships between tables (if you have multiple tables)
- Apply data source filters

### Data Types
Ensure your fields have the correct data types:
- **Order Date**: Date & Time
- **Product Category, Subcategory, etc.**: String (text)
- **Sales Amount, Quantity, etc.**: Number (decimal)

## Understanding the Tableau Interface

### Workspace Elements
- **Data pane**: Shows dimensions (blue) and measures (green)
- **Sheets tabs**: Create new worksheets, dashboards, or stories
- **Shelves and Cards**: Rows, Columns, Filters, Pages, and Marks
- **Show Me**: Suggests visualization types based on selected fields
- **Marks card**: Controls the visual appearance (color, size, shape, etc.)

### Dimensions vs. Measures
- **Dimensions**: Categorical fields (blue pills)
- **Measures**: Numerical fields that can be aggregated (green pills)

## Creating Basic Visualizations

### Pie Chart: Sales Distribution by Region
1. Click on the "Show Me" button in the top right
2. Select the pie chart icon
3. Drag "Region" to Color on the Marks card
4. Drag "Sales Amount" to Angle on the Marks card

### Scatter Plot: Profit vs. Sales

2. Drag "Region" to Columns
3. Drag "Sales Amount" to Color on the Marks card
4. Change the Mark type to "Square" using the dropdown in the Marks card

## Working with Dates

### Creating a Time Series Analysis
1. Drag "Order Date" to Columns
2. Right-click the date pill and select the appropriate date level (Day, Month, Quarter, Year)
3. Drag "Sales Amount" to Rows
4. Right-click the "Order Date" pill and select "Show Missing Values" to ensure a continuous date axis

### Year-over-Year Comparison
1. Create a calculated field for the year: `YEAR([Order Date])`
2. Drag this field to Color on the Marks card
3. Create a Month calculated field: `MONTH([Order Date])` 
4. Drag the Month field to Columns
5. Drag "Sales Amount" to Rows

## Geographic Mapping

### Creating a Basic Map
1. Drag "Country" to the center of the view (or to Detail on the Marks card)
2. Tableau will automatically create a map
3. Drag "Sales Amount" to Color on the Marks card
4. Drag "Sales Amount" to Size on the Marks card

### Drill-Down Map
1. Drag "Country" to Detail on the Marks card
2. Drag "State/Province" to Detail on the Marks card
3. Drag "City" to Detail on the Marks card
4. Add "Sales Amount" to Color and Size
5. Use the Map menu to adjust map layers and background styles

## Creating Calculated Fields

### Profit Margin Calculation
1. Right-click in the Data pane and select "Create Calculated Field"
2. Name it "Profit Margin"
3. Enter the formula: `[Profit] / [Sales Amount]`
4. Click OK
5. Use this new field in visualizations by dragging it to various shelves

### Sales Growth Calculation
1. Create a new calculated field named "Sales Growth"
2. Use a table calculation with the formula: `(SUM([Sales Amount]) - LOOKUP(SUM([Sales Amount]), -1)) / LOOKUP(SUM([Sales Amount]), -1)`
3. This calculates period-over-period growth

### Customer Segmentation
1. Create a calculated field named "Customer Value Segment"
2. Enter a formula using IF/THEN logic:
   ```
   IF SUM([Sales Amount]) > 5000 THEN 'High Value'
   ELSEIF SUM([Sales Amount]) > 1000 THEN 'Medium Value'
   ELSE 'Low Value'
   END
   ```

## Building Filters

### Quick Filters
1. Drag "Product Category" to the Filters shelf
2. In the dialog that appears, select the categories you want to include
3. Right-click the filter pill and select "Show Filter" to add it to the view

### Date Range Filters
1. Drag "Order Date" to the Filters shelf
2. Choose "Range of Dates" and set your date range
3. Right-click the filter pill and select "Show Filter"
4. Choose a filter style (slider, relative date, etc.)

### Top N Filter
1. Drag "Product Name" to the Filters shelf
2. Select the "Top" tab
3. Choose "By Field" and set it to show the top N products by Sum of Sales Amount
4. Set N to the desired number (e.g., 10)

5. Set a default value
6. Click OK
7. Right-click the parameter and select "Show Parameter"

### Using Parameters with Calculated Fields
1. Create a calculated field named "Sales vs Target"
2. Enter the formula: `SUM([Sales Amount]) - [Sales Target]`
3. Use this field to color code performance against target

### Dynamic Measure Selection
1. Create a parameter named "Select Measure" with a data type of "String"
2. Add a list of allowed values: "Sales", "Profit", "Quantity", etc.
3. Create a calculated field named "Selected Measure" with the formula:
   ```
   CASE [Select Measure]
   WHEN 'Sales' THEN [Sales Amount]
   WHEN 'Profit' THEN [Profit]
   WHEN 'Quantity' THEN [Quantity]
   END
   ```
